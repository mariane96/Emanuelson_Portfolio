## My Selected Data

I selected my data from DataUSA when I found a page on their site dedicated to people who have received visual or performing arts degrees and where they are now. I selected the 3 main datasets because they were the topics most interesting to me, but I may end up going back and finding another dataset from the same page if I find an interesting gap or missing point in my data anaylsis and story!
