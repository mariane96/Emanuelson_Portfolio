Marian's Portfolio for Telling Stories with Data - Fall 2019

# About Me
I am a second year Master of Arts Management student. I am currently planning to go into the field of event coordination in an arts or university setting! I currently live in Shadyside with my boyfriend and our two black cats, Geno and Crosby. (We also really like hockey.)

# What I Hope To Learn
I don't really have a background in data or dataviz, so I'm looking forward to getting more practice and experience with it! I want to learn more about how I can effectively utilize dataviz tools in everyday office life and make them in a way that everyone can understand them. I want to get comfortable working with data and some stand-by dataviz tools.
