## User Research

### Target Audience
My target audience for my visualizations are people in the visual or performing arts field, recipients of visual or performing arts degrees, or current students working towards a visual or performing arts degree. I think these are the groups of people who would be most interested in location, pay, and current jobs of those who received a visual or performing arts degree. I want this information to be a snapshot of the status of visual or performing arts degree recipients in the US. The people who would be most concerned about that snapshot would logically be the people working in those fields, the people who have those degrees, or the people who are currently getting those degrees.

### Approach to Identifying Interviewees
Luckily, being in an Arts Management program, there is no shortage of people in the visual or performing arts fields or people with visual or performing arts degrees. I plan to show my wireframes/storyboard to a few of my classmates around class time or in Hamburg during a break between classes. These people are within my target audience and are within easy reach for interviews, so they make the most sense for this project and scope.

### Interview Script & Findings

(transcribed using Otter.ai)

#### Most Impactful Findings
- It seemed that respondents had my audience about 75% right. They mainly thought it was people in the jobs outlined or people getting their degrees in this field, so I was happy with their interpretation of the audience. Their other guesses weren’t that far off of those audience bases. 
- Another comment I found interesting was to switch the first two maps. The respondent thought the concentration of subjects in certain areas should come first, followed by where these subjects get paid the most.
- Another concern was the highlighting in visual 3. The respondent wanted all non-degree-related jobs to be in gray, not in the light purple.
- One comment was to maybe look at their education or student debt, if possible. I will go back into the Data USA and see if there is a data set based in education, in any way.

### Changes Made Based on User Research
- I changed the order of the first two visuals to make concentration of people first followed by areas with the highest salary. I actually think this is really the most logical way to introduce the data, so I appreciate the comment from my respondent pointing this out.
- I adjusted my shading of visual 3 to make the bars gray instead of light purple. This will end up highlighting the degree-related jobs without confusing the shading with concentration, as it is used in other visuals.
- I pulled data on what different institutions’ tuition costs, so I added a visualization based on that information due to what one respondent raised as a potentially interesting addition.

[Outline Preview](https://preview.shorthand.com/eD7LOH88KKM9Zpuo)

Linked above is a preview of my Shorthand presentation. It has an outline of my presentation/deliverable and a few potential final visualizations. I will continue to visualize my data and consider revisions for the ones already on the Shorthand platform.
