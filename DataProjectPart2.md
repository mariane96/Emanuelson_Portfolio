# Data Project Part 2

## Initial Wireframe

## User Research

### Target Audience
My target audience for my visualizations are people in the visual or performing arts field, recipients of visual or performing arts degrees, or current students working towards a visual or performing arts degree. I think these are the groups of people who would be most interested in location, pay, and current jobs of those who received a visual or performing arts degree. I want this information to be a snapshot of the status of visual or performing arts degree recipients in the US. The people who would be most concerned about that snapshot would logically be the people working in those fields, the people who have those degrees, or the people who are currently getting those degrees.

### Approach to Identifying Interviewees
Luckily, being in an Arts Management program, there is no shortage of people in the visual or performing arts fields or people with visual or performing arts degrees. I plan to show my wireframes/storyboard to a few of my classmates around class time or in Hamburg during a break between classes. These people are within my target audience and are within easy reach for interviews, so they make the most sense for this project and scope.
